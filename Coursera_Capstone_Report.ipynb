    "As a new Japanese franchise company needs recommendations for their set up with three new high-priced sushi and Japanese food restaurants, they came up with the question which places over the cities of Berlin, Paris and London would be the best to locate their restaurants. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to give them the best recommendation for the new locations in every city, the first question to be answered is: What is the right quarter for a high-priced Japanese restaurant? \n",
    "\n",
    "For the evaluation of this question, we take a few assumptions first: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. As the restaurant will be high-priced, we need to look for quarters with other high-priced restaurants to set up the new location. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Even if one says that competition stimulates business, it is much more likely that a new restaurant will get the most customers if there is less choice or less competitors in the same business area. Therefore, we search for quarters in these cities which are not already dominated by Japanese Food. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we need to find locations where high-priced restaurants are accepted and which are not dominated by Japanese like restaurants to maximize the profitability of the new franchise restaurants.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we search for differences and similarities between the neighborhoods of the cities, based on the above-described criteria.\n"

    "The results of this request are shown in the table below:\n",

    "\n",
    "The sum of the total number of restaurants in all cities is now 466 and the foursquare-API call is now possible because it is smaller than 500 (calls per day).\n",

    "The first and most remarkable, critical point is that the data from foursquare contains restaurants which are not specified to a certain kind of restaurant which means, that these restaurants can be Japanese as well. \n",

    "Another point to discuss is, that clearly not all restaurants of the cities are catched by the database of foursquare network. The neighborhoods may contain Japanese restaurants even if these restaurants are not included in the database of foursquare which means that the cluster shows that the neighborhood has no or less Japanese restaurant but it could have even more Japanese restaurants than other ones. This error could be solved by using a database which is more spreaded in Europe. \n",

One possibility could be, to use the overall income of the employees and the residents of the neighborhoods.
